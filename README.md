# GoogleAPIs
This repo includes all the google api provided by google

## Authentication and Authorization
Usage of all of the APIs requires Authentication and Authorization using the Oauth 2.0 protocol. Oauth 2.0 is a simple protocol. To start, it is necessary to obtain credentials from the Developers Console. Then the client app can request an access Token from the Google Authorization Server, and uses that Token for authorization when accessing a Google API service
