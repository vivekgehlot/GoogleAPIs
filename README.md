# GoogleAPIs
This repo includes all the google api provided by google

## Authentication and Authorization
Usage of all of the APIs requires Authentication and Authorization using the Oauth 2.0 protocol. Oauth 2.0 is a simple protocol. To start, it is necessary to obtain credentials from the Developers Console. Then the client app can request an access Token from the Google Authorization Server, and uses that Token for authorization when accessing a Google API service

##There are client libraries in various languages which allow developers to use Google APIs from within their code, including Java, JavaScript, Ruby, .NET, Objective-C, PHP and Python. [5]

The Google Loader is a JavaScript library which allows web developers to easily load other JavaScript API provided by Google and other developers of popular libraries. Google Loader provides a JavaScript method for loading a specific API (also called module), in which additional settings can be specified such as API version, language, location, selected packages, load callback (computer programming) and other parameters specific to a particular API. Dynamic loading or auto-loading is also supported to enhance the performance of the application using the loaded APIs.[6]
